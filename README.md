### what is RDX tool :
- an opensource bruteforcing script for instagram account's, for educational purposes only :innocent:.

### how does it work : 
- basically by sending password's into the instagram log-in page using the target's username and try to log into the target's account.

### setup and installation : 
- before being able to download the tool's folder and proceed the setup bunch of stuff need to be downloaded :

  - [python](https://www.python.org/)
  - [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - [bash](https://git-scm.com/)
  - [chromium](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/) ( different download sources based on os )
  
- after downloading all these setups proceed the installation of all, next download the tool's folder and proceed these steps : 

  - extract the tool's folder
  - put the tool's folder in the desktop
  - open the git bash terminal and paste this command {cd $'/c/Users/adam\'s pc/Desktop/RDX tool'} in git bash terminal
  - then type this command {bash run.sh} in the git bash terminal
  - a menu should appear then just type b and enter and the modules installation will begin
  
- after the modules installation the first menu should appear and then the setup and installation proccess will be finished

### how to use the RDX tool : 
- after successfully downlading the tool and its modules and libraries you can finally start using by simply following these steps :
  - open the git bash terminal and paste this command {cd $'/c/Users/adam\'s pc/Desktop/RDX tool'} in git bash terminal
  - then type this command {bash run.sh} in the git bash terminal
  - a menu should appear then just type a and enter and the tool will start runing
  - after that another menu should appear and it should be displaying you network info and will ask you to enter the target's name and a list, the target's name can be the target's instagram username or email address or phone number and the list is the txt file that contains the passwords so choose a file and enter its name without the {.txt} extension ( only 2 defaults {test.txt} ; {dictionary.txt} ) if you want to add your own list it must be a txt file and just place in this directory {RDX tool\\libraries}
  - after entering these input's a chromium window should open and the tool will start runing if the tool enters the right pass it will just log into the target's account if not the chromium window will close and the main menu will appear again
